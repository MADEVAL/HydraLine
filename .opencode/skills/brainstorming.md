# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design and get user approval.

## Hard Gate

Do NOT write any code or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.

## Anti-Pattern: "This Is Too Simple To Need A Design"

Every new feature, component, or behavior change goes through this process. "Simple" projects are where unexamined assumptions cause the most wasted work. The design can be short (a few sentences for truly simple projects), but you MUST present it and get approval.

Bug fixes are the exception: they need a **mini-brainstorm** — verify the bug is real, assess its impact and scope, confirm it's not a false report — then proceed directly to the debugging workflow (systematic-debugging agent) with TDD. Do NOT skip the mini-brainstorm and rush to a fix without understanding consequences. Bug verification must follow AGENTS.md rules: reproduce with a failing runtime test (`melos run test` / `dart test`), not source inspection.

## Checklist

You MUST create a task for each of these items and complete them in order:

1. **Explore project context** — check files, docs, recent commits
2. **Ask clarifying questions** — one at a time, understand purpose/constraints/success criteria
3. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — with trade-offs and your recommendation
4. **Present design** — in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section
5. **Transition to implementation** — create implementation plan

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**
- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Before asking detailed questions, assess scope: if the request describes multiple independent subsystems, flag this immediately
- If the project is too large for a single spec, help decompose into sub-projects
- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**
- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**
- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Scale each section to its complexity
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

**Design for isolation and clarity:**
- Break the system into smaller units with one clear purpose, well-defined interfaces, independently testable
- For each unit: what does it do, how do you use it, what does it depend on?
- Can someone understand what a unit does without reading its internals? Can you change internals without breaking consumers?

**Working in existing codebases:**
- Explore the current structure before proposing changes. Follow existing patterns.
- Where existing code has problems that affect the work, include targeted improvements as part of the design
- Don't propose unrelated refactoring. Stay focused on what serves the current goal.

## After the Design

**Documentation:**
- Write the validated design (spec) to `specs/docs/adr/NNNN-<topic>.md` (ADR, per `specs/docs/adr/TEMPLATE.md`) for architectural decisions, or a design-note alongside the relevant `specs/` doc for larger features
- Keep it consistent with `specs/HYDRALINE_SPEC_V3.md` (product) and `specs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (invariants); flag any conflict with non-goals
- Commit the design/ADR to git (only when the user asks to commit)

**Spec Self-Review:**
After writing the spec, look at it with fresh eyes:
1. Placeholder scan: Any "TBD", "TODO", incomplete sections? Fix them.
2. Internal consistency: Do any sections contradict each other?
3. Scope check: Is this focused enough for a single implementation plan?
4. Ambiguity check: Could any requirement be interpreted two different ways?

**User Review Gate:**
After spec review, ask user to review the written spec before proceeding.

**Implementation:**
Transition to the TDD workflow — check `specs/packages/*/api/` for the frozen contract and existing `test/` for related tests, write a failing test, then implement.

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** — Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** — Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** — Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** — Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** — Present design, get approval before moving on
- **Be flexible** — Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense

# Systematic Debugging

## Overview

Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Quick patches mask underlying issues.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.

**Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of debugging.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

## When to Use

Use for ANY technical issue: test failures, bugs in production, unexpected behavior, performance problems, build failures, integration issues.

**When verifying a suspected bug (per AGENTS.md):** write a failing runtime test
in the package's `test/` tree (temporary probes go under `TEMP/`), call the real
`hydraline`/`hydraline_server`/`hydraline_flutter` code, and observe the wrong
behavior — do not conclude from source inspection alone. Tracing the full
execution chain (Phase 1 §5) is mandatory — every function in the call path must
be read to completion. Reproduce with `melos run test` (or a targeted
`dart test test/<file>_test.dart` / `flutter test`).

**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**
- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
- "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
- You've already tried multiple fixes
- Previous fix didn't work
- You don't fully understand the issue

**Don't skip when:**
- Issue seems simple (simple bugs have root causes too)
- You're in a hurry (rushing guarantees rework)
- Manager wants it fixed NOW (systematic is faster than thrashing)

## The Four Phases

You MUST complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

1. **Read Error Messages Carefully**
   - Don't skip past errors or warnings
   - They often contain the exact solution
   - Read stack traces completely
   - Note line numbers, file paths, error codes

2. **Reproduce Consistently**
   - Can you trigger it reliably?
   - What are the exact steps?
   - Does it happen every time?
   - If not reproducible → gather more data, don't guess

3. **Check Recent Changes**
   - What changed that could cause this?
   - Git diff, recent commits
   - New dependencies, config changes
   - Environmental differences

4. **Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems**
   - For each component boundary: log what data enters/exits, verify environment/config propagation, check state at each layer
   - Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks
   - THEN analyze evidence to identify failing component
   - THEN investigate that specific component

5. **Trace Data Flow**
   - Where does bad value originate?
   - What called this with bad value?
   - Keep tracing up until you find the source
   - Fix at source, not at symptom

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

**Find the pattern before fixing:**

1. **Find Working Examples** — Locate similar working code in same codebase
2. **Compare Against References** — Read reference implementation COMPLETELY, don't skim
3. **Identify Differences** — What's different between working and broken? List every difference
4. **Understand Dependencies** — What other components does this need? What assumptions?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

**Scientific method:**

1. **Form Single Hypothesis** — "I think X is the root cause because Y". Be specific.
2. **Test Minimally** — Smallest possible change, one variable at a time
3. **Verify Before Continuing** — Did it work? Yes → Phase 4. No → new hypothesis. Don't add more fixes.
4. **When You Don't Know** — Say "I don't understand X". Don't pretend. Ask for help.

### Phase 4: Implementation

**Fix the root cause, not the symptom:**

1. **Create Failing Test Case** — MUST have before fixing. Use TDD.
2. **Implement Single Fix** — Address root cause. ONE change. No "while I'm here" improvements.
3. **Verify Fix** — Test passes? No other tests broken? Issue resolved?
4. **If Fix Doesn't Work** — STOP. Count fixes tried. If < 3: return to Phase 1. **If ≥ 3: question the architecture.**
5. **If 3+ Fixes Failed: Question Architecture** — Pattern indicating architectural problem: each fix reveals new problem, fixes require massive refactoring, each fix creates new symptoms. STOP and question fundamentals. Discuss with your human partner.

## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Add multiple changes, run tests"
- "Skip the test, I'll manually verify"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- "One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)
- Each fix reveals new problem in different place

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**
**If 3+ fixes failed:** Question the architecture.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast. |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check. |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from start. |
| "I'll write test after confirming fix works" | Untested fixes don't stick. Test first proves it. |
| "Multiple fixes at once saves time" | Can't isolate what worked. Causes new bugs. |
| "Reference too long, I'll adapt the pattern" | Partial understanding guarantees bugs. Read it completely. |
| "I see the problem, let me fix it" | Seeing symptoms ≠ understanding root cause. |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+ failures) | 3+ failures = architectural problem. Question pattern. |

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **1. Root Cause** | Read errors, reproduce, check changes, gather evidence | Understand WHAT and WHY |
| **2. Pattern** | Find working examples, compare | Identify differences |
| **3. Hypothesis** | Form theory, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |
| **4. Implementation** | Create test, fix, verify | Bug resolved, tests pass |

## When Process Reveals "No Root Cause"

If systematic investigation reveals issue is truly environmental, timing-dependent, or external:
1. You've completed the process
2. Document what you investigated
3. Implement appropriate handling (retry, timeout, error message)
4. Add monitoring/logging for future investigation

**But:** 95% of "no root cause" cases are incomplete investigation.

## Real-World Impact

- Systematic approach: 15-30 minutes to fix
- Random fixes approach: 2-3 hours of thrashing
- First-time fix rate: 95% vs 40%
- New bugs introduced: Near zero vs common
